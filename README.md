# Digital-Storytelling-Group-Assignment

The purpose of this project assignment is to become a transmedia producer by creating media content across multiple platforms. Thus, you have to collaboratively make a short film and, additionally, you have to create a comics or a game or a book (audio or augmented-reality) or a real-time animation that connects with the storyworld of your short-film.

## Initial Settings

## Thematic Areas
- Fictional stories
- Non-Fictional stories
- Mixed

**Attention:** Examples & Ideas will be discussed during class!!!

## Steps to consider for the final submission:
1.	You must create a team of 3-5 fellow students (collaborators). See in the [discussion session](https://github.com/merkourisa/Digital-Storytelling-Group-Assignment/discussions/1) the procedure for creating the teams. You must choose a coordinator per team. The coordinator will be responsible for uploading the necesserary documents in his/her repository only in markdown format.
2.	Read the article [**Transmedia Project Design: Theoretical and Analytical Considerations**](Transmedia/transmedia_project_design.PDF) found in the [Transmedia folder](Transmedia/). Start working on your team project by answering the questions indicated in the second section of the article. You should edit the [README.md](Transmedia/README.md) found in the Transmedia folder. In the [Transmedia/dpsdXXXXX/ folder](Transmedia/dpsdXXXXX/) you can find an example that will help you write your Transmedia Design document.
3. Create your design document. You should edit the [README.md](our_design/README.md) found in the our_design folder.In the [our_design/dpsdXXXXX/ folder](our_design/dpsdXXXXX/) you can find an example that will help you write your design document.
4. Create your short film and upload the demo in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). Insert the link of your demo in the [design document](our_design/README.md).
5. Create the additional context (book, game, animation, comic) that connects with the storyworld of your short-film. 
6. Use the answers in step 3 to prepare the presentation of your concept. You should edit the [README.md](our_presentation/README.md) found in the our_presentation folder. During the presentation you will have to define the designed world and explain what kind of media are appropriate for the demo of the story. In the [our_presentation/dpsdXXXXX/ folder](our_presentation/dpsdXXXXX/) you can find a presentation example that will help you prepare your presentation.
